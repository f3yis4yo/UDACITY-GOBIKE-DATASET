# Ford GoBike System Data
## by OLUGBENGA FEYISAYO CHARLES

## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, in Februaury, 2019. The dateset contains 174,952 rows and 10 columns.


## Summary of Findings

Exploration of the data showed There is little or no correlation between the age of riders and the minutes of rides accumulated. Majority of the numerical variables in the dataset had no correlation whatsoever, except for the member age, and birth yer which had a negative correlation. The duration in minute is independent of other variables in the datatset
Most of the users of the bikes were male, with almost 75 percent. It is however obvious that majority of the male gender were subscribers, hence the subscribers were the majority of the users as well, compared to only a little of them which were customers.


It was also discivered that majority of the users were young between the age of 25 and 60, users above the age of 60 were not so common. Although there were outliers in the age distribution, but it was dealt with by grouping the ages into categories. Outside of the major variables, it was discovered that majority of riders prefered to start and end their ride at the same station. I also discovered the bike that accumulated the most ride duration in minutes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the explanatory analysis, I focus on the age distribution of the riders. Correlation between the variables in the dataset is also displayed, while also showing how numercial variables are related to each other.
